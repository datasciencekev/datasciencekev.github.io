## The Basics

* The goal is to build a shiny app and slidify documentation
* Both need to be publicly published
* shinyapps.io and ph-pages, here we come!

## The Application

We chose to keep things simple - use the mtcars data set, predict MPG based on weight, and interact with the user via a text box.

``` {r}
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)
print (model)
```

## The Results

I'm not one to brag, but this is possibly the world's best fuel economy estimator.  Any time anyone needs to know a rough idea of what the fuel econ of a 1972 vechicle, and for whatever reason they happen to know the weight, this should be their go to app.

## Thank You

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed developing data products, and this application in particular.
