## The Basics

* The goal is to build a shiny app and slidify documentation
* Both need to be publicly published
* shinyapps.io and ph-pages, here we come!

## The Application

We chose to keep things simple - use the mtcars data set, predict MPG based on weight, and interact with the user via a text box.

``` {r}
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)
print (model)
```
